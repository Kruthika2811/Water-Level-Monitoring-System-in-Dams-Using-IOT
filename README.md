# Water-Level-Monitoring-System-in-Dams-Using-IOT
This project is a Water Level Monitoring System designed to track and report real-time water levels in dams using IoT technology. The system helps in early flood warnings, efficient water management, and ensuring the structural safety of dams by providing continuous monitoring and alerts.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used:
Hardware: Arduino / ESP8266 / Sensors (Ultrasonic, Float, etc.)

Connectivity: WiFi / IoT protocols (like MQTT)

Software: Arduino IDE / Embedded C / Web server (basic HTML/CSS for dashboard)


üõ†Ô∏è How It Works:
Sensors placed at different water heights detect the current water level.

Microcontroller reads sensor data and sends it to a connected cloud server or local dashboard.

If the water level crosses a threshold, the system triggers an automatic alert.

The monitoring dashboard updates the water levels in real time for engineers and administrators to view.
